# Fizz Buzz

## Overview
Fizz buzz is a game played to help develop maths skills. 


Usually people will sit in a circle, and go round clockwise. Someone is 
chosen to start from 1, they apply the game rules to that number and 
then will say the output. The next person will add one to what was 
previously said and then run the game rules again.


The game rules are as follows:
- If the number is divisible by 3, say "fizz"
- If the number is divisble by 5, say "buzz"
- If the number is divisible by 3 and 5 say "fizzbuzz"
- If the number is divisible by neither 3 and 5 say the current number


For example 1-20 would go like:
1. 1
2. 2
3. Fizz
4. 4
5. Buzz
6. Fizz
7. 7
8. 8
9. Fizz
10. Buzz
